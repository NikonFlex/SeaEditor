This project is about editor that helps people to create scenarios of a sea situation. It was my first experience of development in C++. I have read an article that Qt framework is the best way to start learning C++. So, I decided to start develop simple mini projects, but a person asked me to do this editor. It was my first experience of working in a pair with a client. During development, I have learned how to solve difficult problems with development design and how to create a user-friendly interface.
